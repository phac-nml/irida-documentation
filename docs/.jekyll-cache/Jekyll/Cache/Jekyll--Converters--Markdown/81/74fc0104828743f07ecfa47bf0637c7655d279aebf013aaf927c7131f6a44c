<p>Sometimes you only want to share a small subset of the data in one of your projects with another user. You can share out smaller sets of samples from a project by creating a new project in IRIDA, copying some samples to it, then adding new members to that project.</p>

<p>You must have the role of <strong>Manager</strong> on the project to copy samples to another project.</p>

<p>Once the new project is created return to the project that you would like to copy samples from.</p>

<h3 id="copy-samples">Copy Samples</h3>

<p>{% include tutorials/common/samples/copy-samples.md %}</p>

<h3 id="adding-a-project-member">Adding a Project Member</h3>

<p>Once the samples are copied over to the new project, the last step is to add all users to this project that need access to this data.</p>
