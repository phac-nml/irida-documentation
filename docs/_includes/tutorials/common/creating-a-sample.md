You can add a new sample to the project if you have the project Manager role on the project. To add a new sample to the project, click on the "Add New Sample" button in the "Samples" menu:

Clicking this button will take you to the Create New Sample page.  When creating a sample, you must define the sample name (only upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and the special characters <code>!, @, #, $, %, _, -</code>, and <code>`</code> are allowed) and optionally choose an organism for the sample:

If you choose to set a sample organism, click on the "Organism" drop-down menu and begin typing the name of the organism. For example, if you wanted to specify a sample organism of “Escherichia coli O26:NM”, you would begin to type "Esc" and the menu would allow you to choose from a set of well-defined organism names:

When you've finished choosing the name and organism for the sample, click on the "Create Sample" button.
