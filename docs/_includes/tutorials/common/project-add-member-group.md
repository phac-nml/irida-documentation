To add a group to the project, click on the "Groups" button on the left-side of the page, then click on "Add Group":

You can use the dialog that appears to select a user group, and choose the **Project Role** that the new group member should have:

**Remember**: a project collaborator has *read-only* permissions, and a project *manager* is allowed to modify project details. When adding a user group, **all** members of the user group will have that project role on this project.

**Note**: If a user is added *both* as an individual member and as part of a group, the individual user project role takes precedence over the group project role. For example, if Bob is added to Project 5 as a Project Owner as an individual member, and is in a Group that's on Project 5 as a Project Member, Bob would be given Project Owner permissions to Project 5.

Once you've selected the user group and role to add to the project, click on the "OK" button.
