You can use the dialog that appears to select a user account, and choose the **Project Role** that the new member should have:

**Remember**: a project collaborator has *read-only* permissions, and a project *manager* is allowed to modify project details.

Once you've selected the user and role to add to the project, click on the "OK" button.
