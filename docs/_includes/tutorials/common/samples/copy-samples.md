Samples may be shared between projects. A sample that is shared into multiple projects is effectively *linked* between those projects -- the files contained within the sample are not physically duplicated, and any sample metadata changes in one project are reproduced in the sample for all projects.

You must be a project **Manager** on **both** the project that you are sharing the sample *from*, and the project that you are sharing the sample *to*.

Start by [selecting the samples]({{ site.baseurl }}/user/user/samples/#selecting-samples) that you want to share with another project. When you've selected the samples that you want to share, click on the "Samples" button just above the samples list, and select "Share":

In the dialog that appears you will be presented with a list of the samples that are going to be shared, and an option to choose the project that the samples should be shared to:

![Copy samples dialog.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/tutorials/common/samples/copy-samples-dialog.png)

When you click on the drop-down box to select a project, you can either visually find the project that you want, or you can filter the projects by their name by typing into the text field.

After selecting the project to share samples to, you may select whether users on the new project should have modification access to those samples.  If users on the new project should not be able to modify the samples, uncheck the `Allow modification access to samples in the new project` box.  If you have selected samples that are non-modifiable in your current project you will be unable to give modification access to any of the samples you have selected.

Once you've selected the project that you want to share the samples to, click on the "Share Samples" button.
