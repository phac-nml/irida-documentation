You may download **all** of the files in a sample, or even download the files from multiple samples, by [selecting the samples]({{ site.baseurl }}/user/user/samples/#selecting-samples) that you want to download, clicking on the "Export" button just above the samples list and clicking on "Download":

IRIDA will provide you with a `zip` file containing the sequencing data for all of the selected samples. You can extract the files from the zip archive using the command-line program `unzip`, using the built-in Windows extractor tool, or using a program like [7-zip](http://7-zip.org)

<blockquote>
<b>WARNING</b>: sequencing data can make for a very large download, especially when downloading <i>all</i> of the sequencing data for a project. We strongly recommend that you <i>do not</i> download data to your PC, especially if you are going to be using Linux command-line tools and the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/user/user/samples/#command-line-export">command-line export tool</a> option is available.
