Contact Information
===================

We'd like to think that our documentation is perfect, but we know that installing and running IRIDA can sometimes be not straightforward.

You may also find a bug that you want to report or may want to suggest an improvement to the development team.

You can get in touch with the IRIDA team in several different ways.
